\section{General Information}

The following section gives an overview of the Verification and Validation ( V
\& V ) plan for the Library of Linear Algebraic Equation Solver. This section
also explains the purpose, scope and overview of the document.

\wss{An explicit web-link to your GitHub repo would be nice.}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to plan the Verification and Validation process
for the Library of Linear Algebraic Equation Solver. The main purpose of this
document is to check whether the Library of Linear Algebraic Equation Solver
meets the specifications and fulfill its intended purpose. This document will be
used as the reference and guidance for testing the Library of Linear Algebraic
Equation Solver.




\subsection{Scope}

The scope of testing is limited to Library of Linear Algebraic Equation Solver.
The library includes two linear algebraic solving functions. The scope is
limited to these two solving functions.

\wss{Reference your SRS document}

\wss{Explicitly state programming language}

\subsection{Overview of Document}

The following sections provides in depth information about the V \& V of Library
of Linear Algebraic Equation Solver. The following sections also provides
information about automated testing approach, testing tools. Test cases for
system testing and unit testing are provided.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}

Software which is tested is Library of Linear Algebraic Equation Solver. The
library contains two linear algebraic equation solving algorithms. Given the
initial values of algebraic equation A and B, the program calculates the final
value x by using numerical methods.  \wss{When you use mathematical symbols, put
  them in math mode ($x$).}

\subsection{Test Team}

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

Automated unit testing will be done for the Library of Linear Algebraic Equation
Solver. Unit Testing Framework and R's Test Class will be used in a combination
for automated testing. Syntax checking will be done automatically by the
compiler. The aim of testing is 100\%  code coverage .

\subsection{Verification Tools}

The verification tools which will be used are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The programming language used is R. Comparison is done between the
  RStusio's \wss{proof read} own functional programs with the Library of Linear
  Algebraic Equation Solver by the Unit Testing Framework designed in
  RStudio. The following algorithm \wss{This is an equation, not an algorithm} is used for comparison.


\[\epsilon_{relative} = \frac{Result_{RStudio} - Result_{Library of Linear
Algebraic Equation Solver}}{Result_{RStudio}}\]

\wss{The symbols in this equation are far too long.  You also should use a
  non-italic font for the subscripts.  For instance, you could use
  $\epsilon_\text{rel}$, $x_\text{R}$, $x_\text{LAES}$, where $x$ is the
  solution of the linear system of equations. You also need to do the equation
  component wise and then find the norm, so that you get one scalar value to
  represent the error.  $\epsilon_\text{rel} = \frac{|x_\text{R} - x_\text{LAES}|}{|x|}$}

\item The framework for automated system testing is provided by using RStudio's Test Class .

\item For program debugging and for checking syntax errors the program's IDE (
RStudio ) will be used as a Static Analyzer tool . \wss{proof read}

\item covr which is an RStudio's library is used for code coverage.

\item RStudio's unit test library will be used for performing unit tests on the code. 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Non-Testing Based Verification}
		
Not Applicable  \wss{Your project is quite simple.  To get a higher grade, you
  will need to do something beyond just testing.  Others in the class are
  looking at code inspection and code walkthroughs.}

\section{System Test Description}

System Test is done to verify whether the goals mentioned in Commonality
Analysis are achieved. Input and Output analysis is used to test the system as a
whole by black box testing approach.

\section{Unit Testing plan}



The testing plan for Library of Linear Algebraic Equation Solver is divided into
several unique steps. These sequence of steps also includes specific function
unit tests. The code will be divided into several individual units of code. A
unit is a smallest component of code which can be tested. These units of code
are tested if they are fit to use or not.

The code will be designed in several modules like Input/Output module, Gaussian
Elimination Module, Gauss-Jordan Elimination Module. The basic plan for unit
testing is that I will be using RStudio's unit testing packages. The tests from
the functional requirements will also be used. The unit testing is a stage where
we should test for code coverage. My aim is for 100\% code coverage.
