Most of the relationships in nature are linear, that means their effects are proportional to their causes. For example in Mechanics if we take Newtons second law of motion, \textbf{F = ma} says that force is proportioal to acceleration and mass is the proportionality constant. For example in Electricity if we take Ohm's Law, \textbf{V = iR} voltage across the conductor is proportional to the current flowing though it and resistance is the proportionality constant. These  examples shows us the importance of linear equations and solving them. In matrix notation the general form of linear equation is

 \centerline{\textbf{Ax = B}}

The most important problem in technical computing is the solution of system linear equatons. So the aim is to build a software that solves linear equations which make the work easy. The software will be used by the undergraduate and graduate students, and will be very handy for academic tasks. We will solve the linear equations by giving the input in matrix-vector form. It is developed on windows platform. Expectations are the Software will be reliable, faster and accurate.

  of each line.  This makes it much easier to see diff's between different
  version of your documentation, and it makes it easier for me to read your
  source code, since my editor does not have auto wrapping.}
